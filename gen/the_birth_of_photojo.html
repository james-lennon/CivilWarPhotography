<p>Pictured on the left is Alexander Gardner's "Sharpshooter's Last Sleep," and on the right, Gardner's "Home of a Rebel Sharpshooter." The same body is pictured in both photographs; it is likely Gardner had moved the body in order to get a different shot.  This was common practice, as photographers used death and the war in order to capture different scenes that would be of interest to the American public ("The Civil War: The Birth of Photojournalism.").  The increasing role and presence of photographers in the war make the dawn of a new and influential medium, as the Civil War marked the birth of photojournalism. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before the Civil War, photography had established itself as a new vision of reality and as an art form; the Civil War would allow it to flourish as a commercial enterprise. ("Truthful as the Record of Heaven," 83)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The war allowed photography to become a lucrative undertaking, as viewers at home were eager to see real images of the war they heard so much about in newspapers.  The market for photographs exploded with the start of the Civil War, as soldiers headed off to battle wanted their image to be taken before going to war ("Truthful as the Record of Heaven," 83) . This allowed photography to become a legitimate job, as the lucrative prospect of taking photographs and selling them to soldiers became more widespread.  As the war carried on, photographers were sent to the battles to capture the aftermath.  Mathew Brady and Alexander Gardner gained fame through this practice, and they both claimed the credit for coming up with the idea of sending photographers to battlefields.  After his election, Lincoln himself helped equip Mathew Bradys studio with additional cameras and equipment to be better prepared to take photographs of the Union soldiers ("Truthful as the Record of Heaven," 84).  </p>

<p>This type of photographic documentation of the war was largely only in the North.  Part of this was because of the Unions naval blockade of the South, making it very difficult for them to receive the necessary camera equipment.  Many of the battles took place in the South, destroying the southern infrastructure and transportation systems.  Even if they had access to camera equipment, this made it increasingly difficult for photographers to get to battles to take photographs of the aftermath ("Truthful as the Record of Heaven," 84). As a result, the task of documenting the war through photography was largely left to the Northerners. Pictured on the right is a photograph destroyed railroad tracks in the South, part of the Georgia Central Railroad ("The Civil War: The Birth of Photojournalism.").  </p>

<p>Ever aware of the importance of photography in creating a public image, Lincoln had a photographic portrait taken by Mathew Brady on the same day as his famous Cooper Union Address.  He later commented, "[In] his ready way Brady and Cooper Institute made me President" ("Truthful as the Record of Heaven," 85).  </p>
