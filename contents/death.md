# Photography and Death

***

While Frederick Douglass made use of the photograph for its objective power for truth telling, he also acknowledges its death-like nature in Pictures and Progress: “Byron says, a man always looks dead, when his Biography is written. The same is even more true when his picture is taken. There is ever something statue like about such men.”  The infamous 19th century poet Emily Dickinson held an even more extreme opinion of photography. Dickinson’s poetry is heavily focused around the theme of death. In her article Death's Surprise, Stamped Visible Eliza Richards analyzes Dickinson’s poetry in the context of Civil War photography. Richards demonstrates how Dickinson insists “photography deadens not only the subject, but also the viewer” (15). Photographs for Dickinson represent a presence that is no longer with us. Even if that subject is still alive today, an image has no means of communicating with us, and thus can be seen as simply a memory bundled with the past. Thus, photography could be seen as a twofold truth: while being purely objective, showing no falsehood of a subject and lacking no detail, photographs also flatten life into a still, immovable image. The photograph becomes a “mirror with a memory” that “freezes the viewer rather than enlivening the subject” (Richards 25).

This perspective of photography comes largely due to the influence of the Civil War: the large amount of casualties suffered throughout, and the use of photography to capture these morbid scenes. Though Richards does not have direct evidence of Dickinson seeing the following images, all of the poems she discusses were written in the middle of 1862, in the midst of the war. One such example of the influence of photography’s role as a medium for death was at the battle of Antietam. The battle, taking place in a cornfield near Antietam Creek was said to be “the most picturesque battle of the war” by a sketch artist for Frank Leslies’ Illustrated and was packed with spectators (Richards 21). The beauty of the surrounds proved a sort of irony, as Antietam quickly became renowned as the bloodiest day in the Civil War (and American History). While the war was reaching its climax, photography was as well—famous photographer Alexander Gardner captured many images of the dead at Antietam:

>“Alexander Gardner recorded 45 stereoscopic glass negatives—the first photographic images of dead American soldiers on the battle….the images from those negatives went on display in Brady’s New York gallery where an unnamed New York Times reported wrote of the ‘terrible distinctness’ of these images” (Daukantas 29).

These photographs of death and battle scenes seem oddly calm and still to the modern eye.  This is mostly as a result of the bulky and fragile equipment used for photography during the war; the unwieldy cameras and long exposure made it impossible to capture any battle action, so photographers instead took photographs of the morbid aftermath of these battles.  It was also common practice to move the bodies after a battle, using the dead as props to convey the photographer's macabre images (“Guest Editors' Introduction: Photography at War," 1).
